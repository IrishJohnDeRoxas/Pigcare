The disease is spread by nose-to-nose contact, and in feces from infected swine or wild birds. Erysipelas is rarely seen in pigs younger than 8 weeks of age because they are protected by antibodies in the sow’s colostrum. It is most often seen in growing pigs near market weight, and young breeding stock. Erysipelas can affect the pig’s joints, leading to chronic arthritis.",

Treat affected pigs with injectable penicillin at 12-hour intervals for 4 consecutive days, or administer two doses of long-lasting penicillin 48 hours apart.
